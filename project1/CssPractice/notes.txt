ðŸŸ¨ 1. width

    ðŸ”¹ width sets the exact width of an element â€” no matter how big or small the screen or container is.
    âœ… Always exactly 300px wide, even if the screen is smaller.

    ðŸŸ© 2. max-width

    ðŸ”¹ max-width sets the maximum width an element can grow to, but allows it to shrink if needed.
    âœ… The box:

    Will be 100% of its parent container, but not more than 300px

    Will shrink on smaller screens
